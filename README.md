# CTF-Sardina
CTF-Sardina is a beginner-level CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge based only on files. Each level is a password-protected, weak but effective, zip file. 

The challenge needs only:
- a decent editor
- a terminal
- a scripting language
- internet connection (can help...)
- intuition

You need to find the flag into the level001 to unzip the level002 with the flag as the password, and so on...

The level001 password is `Croc0dilesRa1nstorm`

## Have fun!

P.S. The repository is continuously uploading and updating levels ...
